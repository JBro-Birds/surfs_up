## Overview of Project

a Surf and Shake shop serving surfboards and ice cream to locals, tourists, and of course, yourself.

You have some savings you're willing to invest, but we'll need some real investor backing to get this off the ground. So after putting together a strong business plan, you reach out to an investor, W. Avy, who is famous for his love of surfing. Your first meeting with him goes extremely well, but he has one concern, what about the weather?

He's extremely serious about this. He invested in a surf shop early in his career. However, he didn't ask for any weather analysis and that early venture was rained out of existence. W. Avy knows you've been learning how to properly analyze data and asks if you can run some analytics on a weather data set he has from the very island where you'd like to open your shop, the beautiful Awahoo.

Jupyter notebook file: we will continue to use Jupyter Notebook for our weather analysis. The name of the file is climate_analysis.ipynb. This file will have all of the structure to help you get started on your analysis. Let's get started by downloading the notebook.

SQLite database: W. Avy has stored the weather data in a SQLite database. All SQLite databases are flat files, which means that they don't have relationships that connect the data to anything else. As a result, flat files can be stored locally, which will help us move more quickly through the analysis.

We'll be using SQLite to store the weather data that W. Avy shared with us and that we'll need for our analysis.

You know there is a slight possibility that W. Avy will ask you to duplicate this process in the future (to open other shops, or if Oahu doesn't turn out to be a good fit). So, as you work through the process of getting started with SQLite, you make a note to make sure to take your time and really understand what you are doing so that you can do it again in the future.

Now, let's think about precipitation. W. Avy is concerned about the amount of precipitation on Oahu. There needs to be enough rain to keep everything green, but not so much that you lose out on that ideal surfing and ice cream weather.

You know that you can set W. Avy's mind at ease by analyzing precipitation levels and showing him the cold, hard, data that backs up Oahu as the perfect place to surf. You have the last 12 months of precipitation data already loaded into your SQLite database, so you are ready to go.

W. Avy supplied you with the data he wants us to use and has asked you to look at a full year of data. When deciding how to parse the data, you remember that his favorite day is August 23, 2017 because it's the anniversary of the first time he ever went surfing and had ice cream on the same day. So, you decide to start the analysis there.

W. Avy doesn't just want to see a list of data; he wants to understand trends in the data. You know just the thing that will help; you're going to create a plot of precipitation scores in chronological order. Rather than simply showing him whether it rained on a given day, you'll show him how much it rained and if it was raining on the previous or subsequent days as well. Remember, your goal isn't just to crunch the numbersâ€”it's to help W. Avy really feel good about his investment.

### Purpose
W. Avy likes your analysis, but he wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.
