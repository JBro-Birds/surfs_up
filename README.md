# surfs_up

## Overview of Project

With my savings I'm willing to invest in a Surf and Shake shop serving surfboards and ice cream to locals and tourists, but I'll need investor backing during the startup phase.  I've put together a strong business plan and reached out to W. Avy, an investor who is famous for his love of suring.  The initial meeting with W. Avy went well but he has a concern about how the weather would impact the business.  W. Avy was burned in the past with what ended up as a failed surf shop which he believes was due to bad weather, and because of this he's concerned about the amount of precipitation on Oahu.  W. Avy knows I'm learning how to properly analyze data and asks if I can run some analytics on a weather data set he has from the very island where I'd like to open my shop, the beautiful Awahoo.

W. Avy has supplied me with the data he wants us to use and has asked me to look at a full year of data.  W. Avy doesn't just want to see a list of data, rather he wants to understand trends in the data.  For this analysis I'll use my Jupyter notebook, SQLite, Python and Pandas skills to plot precipitation scores in chronological order and show him how much it rained and if it was raining on the previous or subsequent days as well for a specific time period.

Jupyter notebook file: we will continue to use Jupyter Notebook for our weather analysis. The name of the file is climate_analysis.ipynb. This file will have all of the structure to help you get started on your analysis. Let's get started by downloading the notebook.

SQLite database: W. Avy has stored the weather data in a SQLite database. All SQLite databases are flat files, which means that they don't have relationships that connect the data to anything else. As a result, flat files can be stored locally, which will help us move more quickly through the analysis.

We'll be using SQLite to store the weather data that W. Avy shared with us and that we'll need for our analysis.

You know there is a slight possibility that W. Avy will ask you to duplicate this process in the future (to open other shops, or if Oahu doesn't turn out to be a good fit). So, as you work through the process of getting started with SQLite, you make a note to make sure to take your time and really understand what you are doing so that you can do it again in the future.

You know that you can set W. Avy's mind at ease by analyzing precipitation levels and showing him the cold, hard, data that backs up Oahu as the perfect place to surf. You have the last 12 months of precipitation data already loaded into your SQLite database, so you are ready to go.

### Purpose
W. Avy likes your analysis, but he wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.
